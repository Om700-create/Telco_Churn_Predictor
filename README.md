# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical customer data, we can identify factors that contribute to churn and create predictive models to assist in customer retention strategies.

### Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis of customer data to understand patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
- **Deployment**: A Flask application that allows users to interact with the model in real-time.
- **Result Analysis**: Interpretation of results and visualization of important features contributing to churn.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
