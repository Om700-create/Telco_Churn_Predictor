# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

The **Customer Churn Prediction** project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing historical customer data, the project seeks to identify key factors influencing churn and provide insights to enhance customer retention strategies. The implementation includes comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and deployment.

### Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: In-depth analysis of customer data to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transformation of raw data into meaningful features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of various machine learning models, including hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model effectiveness using relevant metrics and visualizations.
- **Deployment**: A Flask-based web application that allows real-time interaction with the predictive model.
- **Result Analysis**: Comprehensive interpretation of model results and visual representation of significant factors contributing to churn.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Flask
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## Usage

### Running Jupyter Notebooks
- Open the `notebooks` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks sequentially to explore the dataset, engineer features, train models, deploy the model, and analyze the results.

### Flask Application
- Launch the Flask application located in the `src` directory by executing:
  ```bash
  python app.py
Access the application via your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the predictive model.
Testing
Execute the following command in the root directory of the project to run the unit tests:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover -s tests
